Welcome to my website! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Boston University.

My fields of interest are health economics and industrial organization. My research focuses primarily on public policies and the vertical relation in the health insurance market and the health care provider market.

I will be available for interviews in this job market cycle.
